# Em's roots

This is my GMTK game jam 2021 submission; I worked as a solo developer, so it's not perfect, but it was good enough to place in the top 100 out of 5726 entries.

Music and sound effects are missing.

If you want to try the game, it's available on [itch.io](https://nzd-1.itch.io/ems-roots), 
or you can clone the repository and find compiled versions for Windows and Linux in the `exports` directory.
